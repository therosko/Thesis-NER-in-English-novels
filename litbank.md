Issues:
* The entites in the novels are analysed on different levels, which means that the files do not have the same structure (num of columns).
* The entity annotation layer of LitBank covers six of the ACE 2005 categories in text: People (PER), Facilities (FAC), Geo-political entities (GPE), Locations (LOC), Vehicles (VEH), Organizations (ORG)
* Litbank treats words containing a hyphen as one entity (e.g. WAISTCOAT-POCKET). We split those for consistency.
