## Master Thesis: Named Entity Recognition in Novels

## Status Updates
* Setting up an environment to replicate the experiments from ["Evaluating named entity recognition tools
for extracting social networks from novels" by Niels Dekker, Marieke van Erp & Tobias Kuhn](https://github.com/Niels-Dekker/Out-with-the-Old-and-in-with-the-Novel). Currently, I have managed to install all tools and am continuing with the step-by-step replication. 
* Reading on the basics of NLP - "Natural language processing for online applications: Text retrieval, extraction and categorization" by Jackson and Moulinier
* Writing up a (short) summary/theoretical background on NLP - basic concepts and tools
